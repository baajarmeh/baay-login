2. Clone this repository and install its dependencies.

		> git clone git://github.com/baajarmeh/baay-login.git
		> cd baay-login
		> npm install

3. In a separate shell start the MongoDB daemon.

		> mongod

4. From within the node-login directory, start the server.

		> node app

5. Open a browser window and navigate to: [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

## Password Retrieval

To enable the password retrieval feature it is recommended that you create environment variables for your credentials instead of hard coding them into the [email dispatcher module](https://github.com/baajarmeh/baay-login/blob/master/app/server/modules/email-dispatcher.js).

To do this on OSX you can simply add them to your .profile or .bashrc file.

	export EMAIL_HOST='smtp.gmail.com'
	export EMAIL_USER='your.email@gmail.com'
	export EMAIL_PASS='1234'
